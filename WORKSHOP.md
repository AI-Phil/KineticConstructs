## Search by Category and Tag

Use DataAPI to find products by their product category and/or tags on the products.

```bash
node server_0.js
```


## Search using Vectorize

Vector search does a semantic comparison between the search query and the product description.

```bash
node server_1.js
```


## Search with Hybrid Search

Hybrid search combines both semantic vector search along with a ranked keyword search of the product description.

```bash
node server_2.js
```
