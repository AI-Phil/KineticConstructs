(Each base playset includes its own figures too).\n*   **Target Audience:** Grades K-3 (Ages 5-8)\n*   **Focus Areas:** Collaborative Play, Storytelling Structure (Beginning, Middle, End), Community Roles, Social Studies, Vocabulary Development, Digital Literacy (Basic AR interaction).\n*   **Time Estimate:** Multiple sessions. Setup/Assembly (1 per group) + Exploration + Guided Storytelling Activities (30-45 min each).\n*   **Required:** 3x compatible tablets/smartphones with the 'Kinetic ImagiWorlds' app installed.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n*   Students will collaborate in small groups to build/arrange a city environment.\n*   Students will identify different community helper roles.\n*   Students will use RFID figures and AR technology to trigger events and gather information within a digital narrative context.\n*   Students will collaboratively create simple stories involving characters, settings, and problems/solutions within the city theme.\n*   Students will practice sequencing events in a story.\n*   Students will develop oral language skills by narrating their stories or describing AR interactions.\n\n## Preparation\n\n*   **Materials:** Assemble the 3 playsets (or have student groups do it). Ensure all figures are present. Charge tablets and install/update the Kinetic ImagiWorlds app. Test AR functionality on each playset.\n*   **Space:** Requires sufficient table or floor space for 3 playset stations and small groups to work.\n*   **Grouping:** Plan small groups (2-4 students) per playset/tablet.\n*   **Familiarization:** Explore the app's Kinetic City Downtown experience yourself to understand figure interactions and AR triggers.\n\n## Lesson Plan / Activity Ideas\n\n1.  **Introduction & Exploration (Session 1):**\n    *   Introduce the concept of community helpers and city environments.\n    *   Divide into groups, assign playsets/tablets.\n    *   Guide assembly (if needed) and basic app connection/AR viewing (refer to [Kinetic City Downtown AR Playset](/product/IW-CTY-001) docs).\n    *   Allow free exploration: students place different figures near buildings and observe the AR effects and dialogues. Discuss what each helper does.\n2.  **Guided Story Prompt (Session 2):**\n    *   Provide a simple story starter prompt, e.g., \"The Baker needs help delivering a big cake across town, but there's a problem...\"\n    *   Groups use figures and AR interactions to continue the story. Which other helpers might get involved? (e.g., Police Officer helps with AR traffic). Where does the baker need to go?\n    *   Students use the app to trigger relevant AR scenes/interactions and narrate their story collaboratively.\n3.  **Problem/Solution Stories (Session 3):**\n    *   Present groups with a simple city problem (e.g., \"A kitten is stuck in an AR tree!\", \"Someone lost their AR wallet\", \"The traffic light AR is broken\").\n    *   Groups must decide which community helper figure(s) to use and place them in the playset to trigger AR interactions that solve the problem.\n    *   Encourage them to describe the steps taken.\n4.  **Create-a-Day Story (Session 4+):**\n    *   Groups choose a community helper figure.\n    *   They map out a 'day in the life' using the playset and app, placing the figure at different locations to trigger job-related tasks and interactions.\n    *   Students sequence these events into a short narrative.\n    *   Optionally record narration using tablet's voice memo or screen recording.\n5.  **Cross-Group Interaction (Advanced):**\n    *   Create scenarios where an event triggered at one group's playset requires help from a figure at another group's station (requires educator facilitation).\n\n## Classroom Management & Tips\n\n*   **Device Management:** Label tablets and ensure they are charged. Have a clear process for app usage.\n*   **Collaboration:** Encourage turn-taking with figures and tablet control within groups.\n*   **Differentiation:** Support younger groups by providing more structured prompts; challenge older groups with more complex scenarios or creative freedom.\n*   **Focus on Story:** Guide students to think about sequence, characters, and simple plot, using the AR as a tool, not just a novelty.\n*   **Technical Support:** Be prepared for basic AR/RFID troubleshooting (refer to [Kinetic City Downtown Troubleshooting Guide](/document/IW-CTY-001_TG_v1.1)).\n\n## Curriculum Connections\n\n*   **Language Arts:** Storytelling, Sequencing, Vocabulary, Oral Presentation.\n*   **Social Studies:** Community Roles, City Life, Occupations.\n*   **Technology Literacy:** Basic AR interaction, Using apps.\n\nRefer to individual product documents (ASG, AUG, GMG, TG, SC) for [Kinetic City Downtown AR Playset](/product/IW-CTY-001) for detailed technical information."}
