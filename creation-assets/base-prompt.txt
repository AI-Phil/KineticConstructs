Document Structure: While content varies, the types of documents needed per product family will be similar. A ConstructoBot will almost always need an Assembly Manual, User/App Guide, Coding Guide, Troubleshooting, and Safety. This structure helps manage documentation.
Versioning: Each document would need version control (e.g., _v1.0, _v1.1, _v2.0) as products or software are updated.
Unique IDs: Assign unique IDs to each product (like CB-SPDR-009) and potentially each document for easy reference.
This framework provides a solid foundation for your fictional company, Kinetic Constructs, and its extensive, document-heavy product line. It balances fun/relatability with the required complexity for technical documentation.
